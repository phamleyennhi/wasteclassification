Project "An effective waste classification system: a system of a portable device that classifies the waste in real-time and is connected to a tracking app that contains the related environmental updates"
----------------------Nhi Pham Le Yen, Maryam Khalifa Al Marzooqi----------------------

This jupyter notebook in this repository is part of a larger project where we aim to develop an effective waste classifcation consisting of:
- A device installed in the waste collection location. This device will help sort the trash to the right bin by capturing the image of the trash, classifying the trash using deep learning, and informing the customer of the category of the trash. 
- A tracking app. This app will provide the map of locations for trash bins/special trash collection, information on personal recycling rate, and a review section including improvement section, complaint section and adding for the new type of trash.

In the jupyter notebook, we use dataset from Kaggle for two types of trash (organic and recyclable) and apply convolutional neural networks to the model for classification.
