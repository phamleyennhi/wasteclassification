Project "An effective waste classification system of a portable device that classifies the waste in real-time and a connected tracking app for environmental updates"

This jupyter notebook in this repository is part of a larger project where we aim to develop an effective waste classifcation consisting of:
- A portable device installed in the trash bin location. This device helps sort the trash to the right bin by applying a deep learning algorithm and informing the customer of the category of the trash. 
- An online tracking app. This app provides the map of trash bin locations, information on personal recycling rate, and a review section.

In the jupyter notebook, we use dataset from Kaggle for two types of trash (organic and recyclable) and apply convolutional neural networks to the model for classification. 

The Google Colab version of the project can also be found here: shorturl.at/ltFJV
